      <description>Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. These tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised.
Supervised Learning Broadly speaking, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and public policy.
Unsupervised Learning With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data.</description>
