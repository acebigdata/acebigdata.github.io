Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data.
These tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised.

## Supervised Learning

Broadly speaking, supervised statistical learning involves building a
statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more
inputs. Problems of this nature occur in fields as diverse as business,
medicine, astrophysics, and public policy.

## Unsupervised Learning

With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising
output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data.
